	<h1>Welcome to my Climate Change Project!</h1>
  	<p>
   Initially, i made a loopy model to demonstrate what my social issue and its conflict would be which i'll paste the link to below. the problem demonstrated in my loopy model was that origionally there was this woman by the water enjoying her day. soon after, this bad man/ the antagonist comes in with a trash bin. the protagonist and the antagonist then have a small dispute which will lead to the man dumping his garbage into the  water. That causes water pollution in the park whuch was what our social issue project was ment to demonstrate.
